### notes
- clicking the down arrow on the table will show the absract of the resepctive document
- you can run npm run rest to run a quick jest test
- I added a helper file in my routes folder to do most of the heavylifting parsing the data 
	- I did this in order to improve readabilty and make my api more modular
- given more time I would improve:
	- search term parsing to sanatize inputs
	- spacing on the ui to fit nicely on all screens
	- more tests
